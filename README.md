## 4.0(introduction)

    react app 설정 및 파일 만들기

    create-react-app을 이용하면 auto-reload를 사용할 수 있다. 
    

## 4.1(tour of CRA)

    css code 를 js code로 바꿔준다.

## 5.0 (introdution)
        
    앞에서 우리는 React.js가 변하지 않는 값을 제외하고 리렌더링 하는 것을 알 수 있었다.

    그런데 한번만 받아도 될 정보의 경우에도 리렌더링에 의해 계속해서 불려지는 문제가 발생한다.
    최초 한번만 필요한 정보를 계속해서 리렌더링 하는 것은 코드의 규모가 클 경우 비효율적이기 때문에 그것을 줄일 방법을 알아보자

## 5.1(useEffect)
    useEffet()는 두개의 인자를 받는 함수이다. 
    첫번째 인자는 우리가 한번만 실행할 함수이다.
    두번째 인자는 나중에 알려준데.. 왜?? ㅠ 궁금





# Basic

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
